### Bug fixes

Actually reuse parser states when skip rules refer to rules also used in other contexts.

Fix a bug where the automaton generated for skip rules wasn't being compressed.

Properly raise an error when different specializations for the same token are given different names.

Fix a bug that prevented `NodeProp.skipped` from being properly attached to node types.

Fix a corner-case infinite loop in the state-collapsing algorithm (and speed it up).

Emit all shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts in a single run, rather than stopping on the first one.

Emit all overlapping token errors, rather than only the first one.

Inline rules can now be anonymous (with syntax `[props..] { body }`).

Dynamic precedences can now be associated with productions, which can help pick the preferred GLR parse when a grammar is ambiguous.

Token `@precedence` declarations can now refer to a parameterized rule by name (without arguments) to indicate that all instances of that rule have a given precedence.

## 0.10.1 (2020-08-07)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where the output file would in some cases have a superfluous comma.

## 0.10.0 (2020-08-07)

Commas in precedence tag, dialect, or external token lists are now optional.

## 0.5.2 (2020-01-15)

### Bug fixes

Fix crash when the top rule had no node name.

Adjust the way states' forced reductions are computed to avoid cycles (where force-reducing multiple times gets you back in your original state).

### Bug fixes

Fix issue where serialized parsers didn't have the top node prop set.

## 0.5.0 (2019-10-22)

The `@detectDelim` declaration must now appear at the top level.

The dash in `@external-...` syntax was droppedâ€”`@external` is now a separate token.

External grammars that default to null must now have the word `empty` instead of `from "..."` (to resolve an ambiguity that syntax introduced).

Actually throw an error when detecing a skip inconsistency.
